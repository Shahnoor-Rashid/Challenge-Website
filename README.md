## Description

This is a website of social media marketing.

- When i thought people who cannot access the website just looking at it, then i thought to make it more accessible.
- I built this project to reach as many people as possible.
- People who cannot read or see the website visually, can benefit from this website by hearing "alt" text if they use screen reader.
